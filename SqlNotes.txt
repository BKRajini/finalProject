CONSTRAINTS:thet are used to set some rules for data while inserting into table.
1)Not Null:column should not contain null values,it can have duplicate values.
2)unique:column should not contain duplicate values,it can have null values.
3)check:it will check for column condition.
4)primary key:It uniquely identifies each row in a table.(parent) AND IT SHOULD CONTAIN UNIQUE VALUES AND NOT CONTAIN NULL 
VALUES.

Sytax for substr:
SELECT substr('CHARACTERSTRING',STARTING POSITION,NO OF CHARACTERS)AS POSITION;

SET OPERATORS:
Union:union operator combines the result set of two or more select statements and avoid the duplicate values.
